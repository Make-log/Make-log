- 👋 Hi, I’m @Make-log, maybe you have seen some of my videos from https://www.youtube.com/c/Makelog
- 👀 I’m interested in make, hack, RF, microcontrollers
- 💞️ If you like what I do, you can support me: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/makelog
- 📫 Video creation takes just a tiny space from my free time, so I'll upload videos only from some projects sporadically

I hope to spark ideas and excite people about creative hobbies. Maybe I'll provide further information about projects here (If I am not ashamed too much for my code being not pretty enough to be published ;) )
